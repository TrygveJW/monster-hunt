## Description

Monster hunt is a game where you hunt for dinosaurs in a jungle. When you manage to take down the dinosaurs you are rewarded with coins, power-ups and letters. Between the levels the letters can be used in a mini game where the goal is to create words with the letters you have collected. The idea for the game came from two 10 year old students at Aalesund International School. The project was part of A NTNU course in Software development.
